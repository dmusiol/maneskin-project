            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              I am a freelance website designer and developer based in A Coruña,
              Spain. <br />
              Collaborating closely with developers, product managers, and
              data-engineers made me curious about the coding world. That is why
              I decided to take the step forward and become a website developer!
