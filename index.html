            <h3>Why Måneskin</h3>
            <h2>From Eurovision winner to Grammy nominees</h2>
            <p>Måneskin is an Italian rock band formed in Rome in 2016. The band is composed of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio. Performing in the streets in their early days, they rose to prominence after finishing second in the eleventh season of the Italian talent show X Factor in 2017. Their international breakthrough ensued when the foursome won the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 for Italy with the song "Zitti e buoni". </p> 
            <p>The band has released three studio albums, Il ballo della vita (2018), Teatro d'ira: Vol. I (2021) and Rush! (2023). They received their first Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category at the 2023 Grammy Awards.
            <br><br>As of 2022, Måneskin has sold an estimated 40 million copies worldwide and garnered 4 billion streams across all streaming platforms, as well as 6 diamond, 133 platinum, and 34 gold certifications.</p>
